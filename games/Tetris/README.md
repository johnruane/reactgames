A fully interactive Tetris game built using React & TypeScript. The game features dynamic animations, scoring, and game logic similar to classic Tetris. Players can drop, move, and rotate blocks (tetrominoes) to clear lines and earn points as the game speed increases.

## Project Description

This project is a modern twist on Tetris, implemented using React and TypeScript. Players can interact with falling tetrominoes to complete horizontal lines. The game speed increases periodically, challenging players to achieve high scores by making strategic moves.

## Prerequisites

- **Node.js** (v14 or higher)
- **npm** (v6 or higher)

## Getting Started

To set up the project on your local machine, follow these steps.

1. **Clone the repository**:
   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/react-tetris.git
   ```
2. **Navigate to the project folder**:
   ```sh
   cd react-tetris
   ```

## Installation
Run the following command to install all necessary dependencies:
  ```sh
  npm install
  ```
  
## Usage
Once the installation is complete, you can start the application in development mode with:
  ```sh
  npm start
  ```
  This will start the Parcel development server, and the app will be available at http://localhost:1234.

## How to Play
The game includes a "How to play" section that provides step-by-step instructions:
  

* Move tetrominoes: Use arrow keys to move tetrominoes left, right, rotate, and accelerate their fall.
* Clear lines: Align tetrominoes to create complete horizontal lines, which will disappear to make space for new ones.
* Scoring: Clearing lines earns points, and multiple lines cleared simultaneously apply score multipliers.
* Game progression: The game speed increases every 30 seconds, requiring faster reflexes and strategies.
* Additional sections cover advanced game logic, scoring, and helpful tips.
